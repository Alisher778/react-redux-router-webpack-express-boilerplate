#React-Router + Express Boilerplate

Built with **browserHistory** in mind, it has a node server running on port 3000 with a wildcard (*) route to direct any incoming request to index.html. 

If you want to define your own `/api` for use in your app, make sure to `use` the controller above the wildcard to adhere to the rule of priority in routing.

##Installation 

1. Fork or clone this repo as needed.
2. `npm install` 
3. `npm run dev` for the development server

##TODO

* Gotta make this deployment ready with a few scripts; most likely specifically for Heroku.
